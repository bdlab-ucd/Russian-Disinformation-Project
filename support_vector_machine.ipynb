The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-\\nterm agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of\\ndollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.\\n\\nSince this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been\\nobliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41.

It would be\\ntreated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and\\nthe Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his\\npresidential veto.\\n\\nThe Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to\\noverturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,\\ninstead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67\\nsenators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or\\nmore Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to\\nsupport the deal.\\n\\nThus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will\\nsimply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking\\nand obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress.

I opted out of the elections and i had many Black people all up in my case,
telling me how i was wrong and how i needed to make my vote count for Mrs.
Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president.

Well now all i want to say is get over Trump and Clinton, they are rich white
people, the elite who were born into and are a part of the system.

not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist

A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between

$65,000 and $75,000 per year.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

Americans.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

they are wrong. We won’t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free Citizens of Texas and we’ve had enough of this Cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let’s remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we’re ready to SECEDE!

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK

North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder Charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop‘s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.

Slager‘s defense attorney‘s:

“The doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.”

The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager‘s
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander‘s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

We‘ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That‘s why today it‘s important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it‘s harsh penalty to pay.",document #: 78,topic #: 9.0

at the train station.

According to a witness, the man who was arrested had originally been driving

across the light rail tracks, when officers on foot attempted to stop his car, at
which point, he drove off.

He added that the man “wasn’t resisting at all until they tased him”

After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay
on the ground, screaming for help.

The man was heard screaming in pain: “My fucking back is killing me! Oh

Two months
before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and “he just started
shooting,” hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

“I was hoping my brother wasn’t dead,” said Boxley.

Beal’s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2—year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

“This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,” - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

shot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not
indict the killer.

Tamir’s mother said she is “mad as hell” with the grand jury’s decision of
declaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, “He was my bright and
shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to
become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn’t

STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

recently said that an internal investigation found the officers were warranted in
using deadly force in the death of the 24-year-old black man.

It's been a year since he died. Justice still hasn't been served.

Come out to honor the memory of Jamar on November 19. We won’t stop
until Change is here!

The
12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann
shot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not
indict the killer.

Tamir’s mother said she is “mad as hell” with the grand jury’s decision of
declaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, “He was my bright and
shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to
become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn’t

The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky Clerk’s request to
keep enforcing her “no marriage licenses” policy — an attempt to avoid
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
court’s preliminary ruling.

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to Choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled

off to jail.

For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she’s
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!

And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
her role only to enact it!

Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
eh?

If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, ""What the hell
is wrong with you people!""

banned all flags and banners, including the US. flag -- and so on. The same

percent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.

Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the

Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.

But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.

The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.

Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn’t care
about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.",document #: 195,topic #: 1.0

l was only 15 when the attacks occurred. l was at school. I remember that
somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC.
We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few
minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom
called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I
remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took
responsibility for the attacks.

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain’s southern coast questioned his gender
identity.

Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family’s request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.

Zornoza published the Vatican’s reasoning for rejecting Salinas’ wish.

It said transsexual behavior “reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one’s own sexuality.”

The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church. Funny.",document #: 218,topic #: 8.0

It’s respect to American history. The Founding Fathers were very smart

The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he
doesn’t want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but
criminals don’t know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase
crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly
state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate.

The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as
usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in

Caitlyn accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2015 ESPY Awards.

Caitlyn is amazing! It was her first public appearance since announcing her
decision to transition.

And her speech brought me to tears. It was very touching and thought
provoking.

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender
woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a
thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the
larger transgender community.

In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is
an American hero of a great courage. Because it takes courage to stand up
and do everything she has done and is doing.

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have
singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred
enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking
“traditional marriage” or infringing on their religious liberty.

Yet in the months surrounding the recent US. Supreme Court decision to
legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have

become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a
group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians,

especially those who support marriage equality.

I believe religions should teach love, they must stop teaching hatred! And I
noticed while progressive Christians are constantly under attack from

conservative Christians, they're not the ones screaming “persecution”. They

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders

Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez was shot and killed by police after he
attacked two military sites in Chattanooga, Tennessee and killed four US.
Marines at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve
Center. Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is
conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a
fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI
has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he
conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist
attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his
letter the terrorist didn’t refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own
volition.

We don’t want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam
have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the
Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to
become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on
their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more

Wedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and
Colorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. In Oregon, judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by
Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing

Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to
serve a same-sex couple.

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges,
conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that
religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new
Claim about how these bakers’ “free speech” is under attack and how

they’re thus the real victims.

There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having
a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do

Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White
House and the US capitol building despite the fact that a gunman killed five
US Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn. President Obama hasn’t ordered to lower
a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at haIf-staff upon
the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or
her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By
contrast, Obama ordered the flags to haIf-staff following on the same day that
as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,

the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn’t yet been lowered in honor of the service

members murdered in Tennessee.

By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen
soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not

deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as
meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist
attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then
decided to kill in the name of Allah.

ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do

Passing the “First Amendment Defense Act” introduced by Sen. Mike Lee
has been anti-LGBT oonservatives’ top priority since the Supreme Court
brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It’s part of the National
Organization for Marriage’s post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential
candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily.
Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
is enable anti-gay discrimination.

Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
religious institutions — for discriminating against people in same-sex
marriages. It’s the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple’s marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

Three days after the Confederate battle flag was ceremonially removed from
the South Carolina Statehouse grounds in Columbia, Atlanta Chapter of the

Confederate Memorial carving.

According to WSB-TV in Atlanta, the organization calls for the removal of all
symbols of the Confederacy from the park, as well as any other state-owned
buildings, parks and lands.

States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
became the President. The US. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).

Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won’t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won’t be tightened.

against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.

When students perceive that they’re not supposed to talk about

harassment.

So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the
Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the
family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their
own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.

“He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn’t worth anything now,”
Mark Wilson said.

When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it’s amoral, it is
beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don’t want to understand that
slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
flag of England or France.

Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.

Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans
should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not Clear. If
somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to
eliminate the party.

which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The
figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the
total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would
actually be larger than 1.24 million.

Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today
there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is
a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the US. economy.
Those who work illegaly don’t pay taxes that are an important part of state

budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
increases crime rates.

Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of
people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a
report of the Center for Immigration Studies.

You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates
social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen
the US. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can’t be the Tower of
Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We

One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.

There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.

But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people’s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.

It is very important for every transgender to be able to Change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It’s not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.

Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
Changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.

Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against
injustice and inequality!

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let’s meet the big player in repealing the ban.

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first

openly trans soldier of the US Army.

He’s astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.

But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

America's military progressing s|ow|y towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let’s hope that these changes“ ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor Charges in
New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'Cause they
couldn’t afford to pay bail.

Under the City’s new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.

The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?

The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.

The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.

Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other
Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a
means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping
the very rich from ever being brought to justice.",document #: 350,topic #: 2.0

National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let’s take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.

That’s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don’t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to “work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision” in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn’t qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it’s a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there’ll be NO MORE of it!

There’s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM’s fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they’ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life’s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone’s life better. At all.

They didn’t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they’re dead and gone, they’ll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they ‘ll be forgotten completely.

A California judge argued against a proposed initiative about the execution of
gay and lesbian people, naming this measure “unconstitutional on its face.”
The Sodomite Suppression Act proposes that “any person who willingly
touches another person of the same gender for purposes of sexual
gratification be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient
method."" The act also will outlaw advocating gay rights to minors.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris Claimed that the proposal was
unconstitutional and it had no place in Civil society. The proposal reminds me
the Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about
such an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President?
Stop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others. We are all equal.

Ruby Rose has long been the celebrity crush of lesbians the world over. But
now that she's a star in ‘Orange is the New Black’, the popularity of this
model, actress, and VJ has grown worldwide.

""Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or
the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender,"" - Rose
said; - ""I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born
one. As a little kid, I was convinced that l was a guy. Then in my teens, I tried
to be quite feminine...And after a little bit, Chopped everything off and am kind
of back where I started. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my
perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes.""

Transgender teen Mercedes Williamson was found dead in a wooded area.
She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year.
Police in George County, Mississippi have Charged a suspect Josh Brandon
Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not
Clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom

Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was
transgender.

Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth
transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National
Coalition of Ahti-Violence Programs’ report hate-motivated violence against
transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a
transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in
1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows
lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call

LITTLE BLACK BOY

The shocking video shows a Central Texas Child trying to get up from a bean
bag Chair in his Classroom, while a Snook Independent School District
employee, Troy Vahn pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small Child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.

In the video footage, Vahn also tells the boy: “Tell me no. When | tell you to
do something, you do it, boy.”

After the Burleson County Sheriff‘s Office launched an investigation, a
“behavior specialist” who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.

The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any Child. The teachers who use excessive force against any Child
should be removed immediately from the Classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.",document #: 443,topic #: 8.0

assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic
disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William
Evans.

A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,
of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.

This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It’s only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against oops, will become the
President of the United States.

Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.

Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!

the police from terrorists.",document #: 458,topic #: 8.0

unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For
centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won’t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we’ve had enough of this Cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let’s remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we’re ready to SECEDE!

Use our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family,
spread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede!",document #: 478,topic #: 3.0

Killer cops involved in the shooting won't face discipline. Chief Janee Harteau
recently said that an internal investigation found the officers were warranted in
using deadly force in the death of the 24-year-old black man.

It's been a year since he died. Justice still hasn't been served.

He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if

— Luke 22:36

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always

was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

It is not Clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards

influences even on Southern people.

The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.

—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

Hardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans’ society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!",document #: 593,topic #: 6.0

The
12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann
shot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not
indict the killer.

Tamir’s mother said she is “mad as hell” with the grand jury’s decision of
declaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, “He was my bright and
shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to

become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn’t
give him a Chance”.

police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the

""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to Close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.

most influential LGBT roles throughout his acting career.

The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by
suicide on August 11 2014.

His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: “As he is
remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the
countless moments ofjoy and laughter he gave to millions.”

Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with
his trademark playfulness.

While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about
discussing the sexuality of his pet pug.

He said: “I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend
and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We’re very
modern.”

When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro-
LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital — one of Williams’ favourite Charities.

Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people’s lives, and
giving back to others was at the top of that list... We will never forget you. And

there’s no doubt in our minds she is a supporter of the LGBT community.
And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman’s touch :-)

Isn’t it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two
brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written

and illustrated by Jason Badower.
Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story -

specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.

""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of
the most recognizable, iconic Characters in the world to be among the first to
step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not
just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.""

Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as
supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark

milestone in LBGTQ rights history.

Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to
Change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her
superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-)

Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.

We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the US. military
has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are
doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don’t fully perform their duties.
First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to
identify people who scour after the wives and Children of the US. Military.
Secondly, families of the US. Military should be taken under special
protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the US. Military family
members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn’t worth a

negative scenario there won’t be any need in their work. And this will be the
final nail in the coffin of the American secret services.

I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will

and magazines having to do with LGBTQ and political issues.
They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and
for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a
torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted
system is against her.

It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must
be “broken” or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she
exposed the government’s crimes, and government really doesn’t like it, and

second, because she’s trans.

Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's Clear
who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint
Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic Character.

But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych
ward?

Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning
forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had
been through enough already!

Free Chelsea Manning you sadistic creeps!!

the US. Embassy in Cuba where the American flag will be raised. The
ceremony will mark the official reopening of the US. embassy along
Havana’s oceanfront promenade that overlooks the Florida Straits.

‘My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and
the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.’ Just 90 miles, but at the
same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba.

The poet added he hopes there’s still possible to achieve “healing” between
the two countries.

‘This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so
surreal sti|...This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new
things to come.’

It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba,
country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country
abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of
these conflicts... And there’s more - severe economic crisis, socialist
dictatorship of Cuban leaders.

It’s time for us to lend a helping hand.

According to an internal document obtained by media, 35,093 combat
veterans are being denied health care enrollment by the Department of
Veterans Affairs because of a computer system error. The vast majority of
these combat vets served in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 19,000 of them have
been pending one month and five years and about 16,000 have been pending
for more than five years. It is known that after five years vets lose their
eligibility for free health care. Moreover approx. one-third of 847,000 vets with
pending applications for health care had already died.

Well, this story Clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man
willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn’t care about its
soldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government’s
slapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans
without medical assistance. And how many of them died before the error in
the database was revealed! A truly disgusting attitude to our soldiers!",document #: 702,topic #: 5.0

I’m gay.” For many
parents first reaction probably will be “How will I ever handle this?” The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child’s sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child’s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free — overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening — by rejecting what they're
hearing (“It’s just a phase; you’ll get over it”); by shutting down (“If you
Choose that lifestyle, I don’t want to hear about it”); or by not registering the
impact of what we’re being told (“That’s nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?”).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child’s sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child’s sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you’re wondering, “ls
she/he sure?” the answer will almost always be “yes”!

DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!

May 16 marked the sixth anniversary of the brutal slaying of 7-year-old Aiyana
Stanley-Jones by Detroit Police Officer Joe Weekley. She was shot by the
cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still
employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was Charged with involuntary
manslaughter and two lesser Charges in her death, but the case was dropped

in January 2015.

Justice hasn’t been served for Aiyana and her grieving family.

We’re planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal
Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police
violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much
attention as possible to the lack ofjustice for the families of those who lost
their beloved ones at the hands of the police.

Roby Rose thinks that it’s not possible to Change someone’s sexuality

I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a
Choice, so it can be “cured”. Just like Ben Carson thinks that you’re Choosing

If Hillary and her party have done so much for us, why is poverty increasing in
the black community? Why we can‘t see economic development? Why there
are no jobs for us? Why black unemployment rate is twice as the national
average? She wasn‘t for us here before the elections, remember? If these

questions are asked more often, it will be another disappointing Election Day
for Hillary Clinton.

Take part in this flash mob and show everybody that no one can manipulate

THINGS
HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF

The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a “medical episode” at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.

On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark‘s wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn‘t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.

Now the question is whether the jail‘s standard operating procedures were
followed.

We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after “fighting” with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.",document #: 910,topic #: 9.0

Dear Mrs. Clinton,

We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the

rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and Children, to die in their homes, and for what?

Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.

You killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the US. but the whole world!

You are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.

8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.

Sincerely,
United Muslims of America",document #: 982,topic #: 8.0

endorsement of Trump. They Claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and
“white supremacists”. The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist
and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared “I don’t know
anything about David Duke... You’re asking me a question that I’m supposed
to be talking people I know nothing about.”

However, “for some reasons” the same mass media in their revelation
campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton’s ties to Robert Byrd, a former
KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of “surpassing eloquence and
nobility”. In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying “It is
almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.”

So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate
can’t be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show
her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.

failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other
there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even

gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from Civilians. You can be put
behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one’s life
becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making
a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all
these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums
of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn’t pay a fine.

who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
occurred shortly after 3 am. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21st St.
That’s just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.

One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has Chosen to remain anonymous.

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 am. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.

The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama’s car and approaching Usama’s friend, who
had gotten out of the car.

The suspect called his friend “brown trash” and told him he had to “leave this
country,”

According to Usama’s account, his friend responded: “This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?”

The incident “escalated really quick,” with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.

He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode Circles around
the two students, Chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!” and screaming, “We’ll
make America great again! We’ll throw you out of the wall!”",document #: 1005,topic #: 8.0

Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players
spoke of killing gay people

Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014
Major League Baseball draft and given a Chance to pursue his dream of being
in the big leagues. But afterjust one season pitching for a Cardinals minor
league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during
his playing days, he was a Closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable
environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging
reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew
Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US.

officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he
was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,
Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.
Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American
police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.
Very ridiculous.

started. The enemy is smart and ruthless. We are losing so far, because our
leader is one of them. Obama has betrayed America and now he is just
executing orders of his bosses.

Obama was always a mere pawn in the hands of Arabian Sheikhs. His latest
orders are just proving it. All these refugees, which we are about to take in,

are soldiers with one simple goal. They are going to try to terrorize the nation
until it agrees to convert.

To win this war we need to gather our forces and elect a leader, who loves
America as much as we do and is willing to do everything it takes to protect it.

enemy and Choke it to death.

Comprehensive High School officials to remove the Old Glory from his

that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious
people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks

particularly the equal rights of voting. It started in North Carolina but it can
spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights.
The US. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits
challenging Changes to the state’s election laws, declaring that the
Challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their
voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same
—day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to
the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver’s
license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world
take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.

INSIDE A SC CHURCH AREN‘T PLEASED WITH DONATIONA PAYOUT

The family members of South Carolina Church massacre victims are upset
with the distribution of donations the Church has received since June

shooting. The Methodist Episcopal Church have decided that the families will
have to divide $1.5 million in donations, while they will keep $1.8 million, with
plans to make Iong-needed repairs to the Church.

For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those
killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation
proceeds.

Nothing will bring the victims of Charleston massacre back, but this money
will help aid in bridging the gap in the loss of an income. Donations are
important for these families since they did not receive a cent from the
government.",document #: 1226,topic #: 5.0

whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not
having the support they need to make rights Choices and schooI-to-prison

ANGRY ABOUT POLICE KILLINGS OF BLACK PEOPLE

The man who was accused of Da Vinci apartment complex arson that caused
the City $100 million in damages testified that he was angry at high-profile
killing of black men.

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted
about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses, he was so mad about
the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

Abdulwalia‘s anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should
not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was
trying to send: having a black president Changes almost nothing.",document #: 1277,topic #: 5.0

This little King right here, now probably 11-years (8-y-o in the pic.) recently
finished a Science Course at Imperial College London University was and still
reigns as the smartest kid on planet earth, studied at the Oxford University at
the age of 6.

And yes, he was too advanced for his required school grade so that lead him
into being homeschooled. He excels in Math, Foreign Languages, History,
Philosophy, IT and Science.

spent a lot of my Childhood in different systems and I had no idea about the
beast that communities of color are fighting. My mother didn't know about the
schooI-to-prison pipeline, she just knew she had a black boy.” Coleman
explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted Clients had shaped his view
of the US. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided.
“It’s not by choice that most of my Clients are African American,"" Coleman

ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.

After the critics complained about the Army‘s unfair burden on black women‘s

hair, the US. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.

Some of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.

The ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.

Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture.",document #: 1474,topic #: 5.0

His mother discovered Leon’s talent when
he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the
Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.

To improve Leon’s skills of painting he began to attend art Classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of “poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black

community.”
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book

with his illustrations is As Big As God.

That’s what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck,
Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon’s mother believed in him.
Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with
your roots!

members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said “We don’t define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.”
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for “communications within the diaspora,” and the
spear symbolizes “whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.”

The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice.

This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear

today, in 2017.

more money for them and they don’t care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals

We’ve been watching our military
commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let’s hope it
will end now when Trump is in Charge.

A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in
Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for US.
Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from
the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish
and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.

We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.
Unfortunately that’s hardly possible because of the corruption in the
Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator
McCain, and that’s why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime Change venture and possibly
another oil war.

We’re fighting radical Islamists, but we’re also siding with Syrian opposition,
the very same radical Islamists, and there’s absolutely no guarantee that
these rebels won’t replace ISIS when it’s gone.

There’s only one Chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American
nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do
now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe.",document #: 1573,topic #: 9.0

After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama’s policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
“We’re not going into Syria”, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here’s what Ron Paul thinks about it: “By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another “surge” in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.”

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We’ve started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there’s no Soviet Union on the world map,
and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way” to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police
ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to Change.

TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER
VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP

Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.

According to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho|ins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him, Ho|ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho|ins in his face.

The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Ho|ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn‘t have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Ho|ins resisted arrest and
Claimed that Ho|ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops |itera|y lied and had no shame.

This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal Charges, even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY! TWO

you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...

All of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn’t Changed you...

We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don’t have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...

Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we
know and love, Chicago.

Sincerely,

Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt

It's not the full letter, but some extracts. lt's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.

As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn’t forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people’s love.
That’s cool that this love goes back and forth!

We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

game but it's better to concentrate on our own issues. When white people do
something for us they see us as strangers anyway, we will always be ""others""
for them.

Thankfully there were a lot of African Americans who devoted their lives to
community. Let's join them! Let's build America again! We talk not only about
houses and infrastructure.

Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim, “Check my bag. I’m telling you I don’t have anything.” And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don’t believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!

In 1947, she became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in
Chemistry when she graduated from Columbia University.

Today, inspiring many young Black girls to become Chemists, Dr. Daly
researched the connection between high Cholesterol and heart disease.

Often “new trends” of American and European cultures is
nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

become a doctor. Since that moment Ebony's mother called her ""Dr. Hilton"". It
wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were
some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but
despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became
the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan

B.
Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving

OurSeres Successfully (GLOSS).
That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's
inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching

others.

downtown Charleston.

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that’s being displaced by development says he’s doing it to make a
statement.

“It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that’s not done here by black folk,” said Joseph Wicks, who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. “None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.”

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
can’t be torn down!

people take the easy and passive-aggressive way out and just leave notes

cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager,
Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.
By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later
apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught

cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.

He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA’s top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar’s Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
the fame and success hasn’t gotten to Henderson’s head though and he has
continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can

Manville spent three years and four months in the slammer for manslaughter.
Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two

profession and went to law school right after his parole.

He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after
waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,
Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented
various inmates and prison guards in Civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.

Kaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward
“Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures” which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.

“I’ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,” he said.

When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don‘t really care
about haters.

Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims

known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.

representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and

leader Osama bin Laden was killed by US. commandos — has spawned cells
elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is

Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,

carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two Civilians. The
sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black US. military veteran of the Afghan war.
As he was captured, he Claimed he wanted to “kill white people”.

There’s no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There’s no
proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
and the police can’t show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».
The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is

While Black activists are trying to strict American government’s attention by
organizing protests, Black bank owners urge Black Americans to transfer
money into their banks.
A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the
main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the
request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money
into BIack—owned banks in the last 5 days.
50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds
from non-Black banks to BIack-owned institutions which would help to
empower and advance Black community.

Most
problems we face happen because we’ve stopped calling things by their
names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We’re
hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don’t
want to ‘offend’ someone.

And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence
is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent’s rallies
and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people
standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives
Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially — the sooner this war

on cops will end and people running a conservative ra|y won’t be afraid to be
attacked by a hateful gang.

Muslim in eastern Uganda strangled his Christian wife to death this month for

gay Club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even
if it’s evident. There’s a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or
just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
if you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough, “Sworn officer of the court” is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it’s a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was
renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and
the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be
filled.

In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing
legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular
culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came
to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things
unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.

He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.
Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was
accused of committing a felony.

Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot
be filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!",document #: 2693,topic #: 5.0

which aimed to “modernize” two references to “Orientals” and “Negros” in
the US. Code that date to the 1970’s. The words will be replaced with “Asian
Americans” and “African Americans,” respectively. “The term ‘Oriental’ has
no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be
gone for good,” Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill
shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become
the first sitting US. president to visit Hiroshima.

In the 17305, a seven-year—old English girl was washed
up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She
became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of

is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck
for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess
she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people

him. There's no doubt he has reasons to think so.

Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa
Caucus. At the same time, she has already demonstrated that she prefers
destroying the nation than losing election. She pledged not to deport illegal
aliens. Moreover, it's known that Hillary is going to take in about one million
Muslim refugees, if she is president.

“I’m telling you, Nov. 8, we’d better be careful, because that election is going
to be rigged,” Mr. Trump said. “And I hope the Republicans are watching
Closely or it’s going to be taken away from us.”",document #: 2838,topic #: 5.0

fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This
is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without
prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black
person’s life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the
second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.
It is now absolutely Clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

we have had our Chance and we never profited out of it. We had a moment to
present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we
refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to
benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.
He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is
the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.
The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by
day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In
no time, “White Power” will be stronger than before.

arrested and Charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
been embarking on demonstration outside the governor’s home but police
officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
Even though the street was Cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on
October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall. Organizers of the
Million Man March call forjustioe, standing against the police and for blacks,
Latinos and incarcerated.

They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
radical groups. Only black activists say “black lives matter”, forgetting the fact
thatjustice is when all lives matter.

Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
be imprisoned.

Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan’s
benevolent intentions.

This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
American extremists to execute him.

should live here legally; he should not break the law. lt’s justice.",document #: 2923,topic #: 8.0

He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if

— Luke 22:36

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

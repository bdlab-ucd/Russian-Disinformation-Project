It’s respect to American history. The Founding Fathers were very smart
people. And it may be assumed they were smarter than many liberals.

The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he
doesn’t want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but
criminals don’t know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase
crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly
state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate.

The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as
usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in

wrong places.

matter.

The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by
the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the
people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing
prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The governmnet
should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It’s pity when

186,"Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an
assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic
disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William
Evans.

A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,
of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.

This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It’s only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against oops, will become the
President of the United States.

Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.

Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!

the police from terrorists.",https://mith.umd.edu/irads/files/original/3d4cb1dbea52ccecae42ca036290b6ec.png,Anger|Being Patriotic|black|blue|coffin|gun|patriotism|photograph|Sadness|U.S. Flag,0,1,1,0

426,"ABOUT 15,500 TRANS PEOPLE ACTIVELY SERVE IN THE MILITARY.
It's estimated that over 134000 American veterans are transgender.
Not long ago these people were forced into hiding. As a result, many were
unable treatments for their gender dysphoria, a state of emotional distress
caused by how the gender someone was designated at birth conflicts with

their gender identity.

Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you
and enduring the consequences which often means the loss of family, lifelong
friends, yourjob, and being the subject of ridicule, discrimination, and often
violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless

they have to do so.

Transphobio s|ur of stupid politicians like GOP presidential hopeful Mike
Huckabee seeking to tremendous efforts of transgender community who are

still struggle for equal rights.
We know how easily bigots and fools who has power are able to reverse

progressive Changes for their own benefit. We can’t let that happen!

These people know what it means to be Transgender and know what it is to
serve in our Armed Forces. We respect their opinion in both of these areas,
especially over those of Governor Huckabee who has not experienced or
accomplished either.

Last week on Friday, May Kieu and Dorothy Dutiel, both 15-year-old
sophomores at Independence High School in Glendale, each died of a single
gunshot wound about 8 am. just outside the school’s cafeteria. The girls
were a couple. Police are calling it a murder-suicide. This heart-breaking

use the incident as a proof that love is a sin!

This is just ignorance! Two Children died and people are grieving! How would
you feel if strangers came to your neighborhood or your school to push their
agenda? These people are just aggravating the situation and traumatizing

McCain, and that’s why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime Change venture and possibly
another oil war.

1450,"This is the story about 19-year-old Juwan Alexander Plummer.
On April 14 the Plummers’ door had been kicked in by burglars.
On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
Grandfather’s shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
When Plummer went to the door, the soared kid fired a warning shot to fend

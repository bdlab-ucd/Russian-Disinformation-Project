A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between

$65,000 and $75,000 per year.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

Americans.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK

North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder Charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop‘s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.

Slager‘s defense attorney‘s:

“The doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.”

The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager‘s
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander‘s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

We‘ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That‘s why today it‘s important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it‘s harsh penalty to pay.","CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO

107,107,"Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months
before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and “he just started
shooting,” hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

“I was hoping my brother wasn’t dead,” said Boxley.

Beal’s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2—year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

“This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,” - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

won't Check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever Check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your
culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by
love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just
love yourself and heal your illness. ?

STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

195,195,"Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41
percent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.

Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the

Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.

But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.

The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.

Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn’t care

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.

Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn’t care
about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions."

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain’s southern coast questioned his gender
identity.

Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family’s request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.

Zornoza published the Vatican’s reasoning for rejecting Salinas’ wish.

It said transsexual behavior “reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one’s own sexuality.”

The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church. Funny.","Vatican Says Transgender Man Cannot Become A Godparent

The Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee unanimously approved
allowing gay adults to serve as leaders, officials said on Monday, in a major

organization.

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders
without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting’s longstanding
policy of Chartered organizations selecting their leaders.

The Boy Scouts of America’s ban on gay adults has stood as a towering
example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America’s most
important and recognizable Civic organizations.

are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay |eaders...This

States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
became the President. The US. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).

Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won’t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won’t be tightened.

We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from
the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism,
law enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for
refugees if not all US Citizens live normally?","A number of refugees has increased since Obama became the President

States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
became the President. The US. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).

Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won’t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won’t be tightened.

On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina
and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina’s
statehouse. Some of them present the KKK’s rally against the removal of the
Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and
Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag.

It is a very Clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a
systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional
heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand
against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.
The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The
government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we
should Clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn’t refuse

So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the
Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the
family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their
own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.

“He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn’t worth anything now,”
Mark Wilson said.

When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it’s amoral, it is
beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don’t want to understand that
slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
flag of England or France.

Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.

eliminate the party.

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let’s meet the big player in repealing the ban.

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first

openly trans soldier of the US Army.

He’s astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.

But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

America's military progressing s|ow|y towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let’s hope that these changes“ ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor Charges in
New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'Cause they
couldn’t afford to pay bail.

Under the City’s new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.

The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?

The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.

The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.

Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other
Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a
means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping
the very rich from ever being brought to justice.","Made In The US: The Justice Turns lnto Business

National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let’s take a look at just how crazy

That’s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don’t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to “work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision” in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn’t qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it’s a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there’ll be NO MORE of it!

There’s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM’s fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they’ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life’s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone’s life better. At all.

They didn’t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they’re dead and gone, they’ll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they ‘ll be forgotten completely.

It was the poster at top, of the bearded man in a pink gown behaving like a

timely message for today.

The two recent US. wars were costly for our nation, to put it lightly. They led
to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or
POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as
key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget,

of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.

This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It’s only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against oops, will become the
President of the United States.

Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.

Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!

the police from terrorists.","Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an

not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it

victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.

not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher

He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if

you don’t have a sword, sell your Cloak and buy one.”
— Luke 22:36

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends."

Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims
and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-
known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.

We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police
representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and
serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!

Join us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between
Charlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. National
Day of Protest. Charlotte, NC"

He said: “I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend
and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We’re very

been through enough already!

Free Chelsea Manning you sadistic creeps!!

#PrideHeroes","THE US ARMY HAS PUNISHED CHELSEA MANNING for possessing books
and magazines having to do with LGBTQ and political issues.
They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and
for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a
torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted
system is against her.

It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must
be “broken” or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she
exposed the government’s crimes, and government really doesn’t like it, and

second, because she’s trans.

Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's Clear
who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint
Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic Character.

But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych
ward?

the US. Embassy in Cuba where the American flag will be raised. The
ceremony will mark the official reopening of the US. embassy along
Havana’s oceanfront promenade that overlooks the Florida Straits.

‘My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and
the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.’ Just 90 miles, but at the
same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba.

The poet added he hopes there’s still possible to achieve “healing” between
the two countries.

‘This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so
surreal sti|...This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new
things to come.’

It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba,
country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country
abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of
these conflicts... And there’s more - severe economic crisis, socialist
dictatorship of Cuban leaders.

It’s time for us to lend a helping hand.

According to an internal document obtained by media, 35,093 combat
veterans are being denied health care enrollment by the Department of
Veterans Affairs because of a computer system error. The vast majority of
these combat vets served in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 19,000 of them have
been pending one month and five years and about 16,000 have been pending
for more than five years. It is known that after five years vets lose their
eligibility for free health care. Moreover approx. one-third of 847,000 vets with
pending applications for health care had already died.

Well, this story Clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man
willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn’t care about its
soldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government’s
slapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans
without medical assistance. And how many of them died before the error in
the database was revealed! A truly disgusting attitude to our soldiers!","35,093 vets were left without medical assistance

715,715,"Most parents aren’t prepared for the words, “Mom, Dad. I’m gay.” For many
parents first reaction probably will be “How will I ever handle this?” The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child’s sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child’s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free — overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening — by rejecting what they're
hearing (“It’s just a phase; you’ll get over it”); by shutting down (“If you
Choose that lifestyle, I don’t want to hear about it”); or by not registering the
impact of what we’re being told (“That’s nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?”).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child’s sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child’s sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you’re wondering, “ls

HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF

The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a “medical episode” at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.

On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark‘s wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn‘t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.

Now the question is whether the jail‘s standard operating procedures were
followed.

We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after “fighting” with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.","ANOTHER BLACK MAN MURDERED IN POLICE CUSTODY. THINGS

Dear Mrs. Clinton,

voices be heard.

campaign, but did you support us before campaign?

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and Children, to die in their homes, and for what?

Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.

You killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the US. but the whole world!

You are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.

8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United

almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its

was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.”

occurred shortly after 3 am. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21st St.
That’s just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.

One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has Chosen to remain anonymous.

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 am. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.

The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama’s car and approaching Usama’s friend, who
had gotten out of the car.

The suspect called his friend “brown trash” and told him he had to “leave this
country,”

According to Usama’s account, his friend responded: “This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?”

The incident “escalated really quick,” with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.

He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode Circles around
the two students, Chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!” and screaming, “We’ll
make America great again! We’ll throw you out of the wall!”","Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men

Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or

Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Williams8kalvin","Brendan Carter decided to pay a visit to his sick uncle and was held by
officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he
was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,
Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.
Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American
police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.
Very ridiculous.

highest percentage of Children with a parent who is or was incarcerated. Can
you believe these numbers?

Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the
country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the
whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not
having the support they need to make rights Choices and schooI-to-prison

poverty without the access to the basic things like healthcare or education.

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted
about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses, he was so mad about
the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

Abdulwalia‘s anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should
not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was
trying to send: having a black president Changes almost nothing.","MAN WHO WAS CHARGED WITH BURNING DA VINCI APARTMENT WAS

After the critics complained about the Army‘s unfair burden on black women‘s

hair, the US. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.

Some of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.

The ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.

Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture.","US. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.

summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next

Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,

1737,1737,"The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, the
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition
strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more Civilians. Just to make it
Clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government
agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this
is more and more Civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development
programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,
Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in
their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
However, terrorists weren’t destroyed in ’30 days’ and it seems like they
won’t be destroyed in the Closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will
do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war ‘for freedom’, it’s
another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood
money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict
can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008.","The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, the

1757,1757,"I believe Ron Paul’s position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right.
After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama’s policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
“We’re not going into Syria”, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here’s what Ron Paul thinks about it: “By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another “surge” in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.”

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We’ve started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there’s no Soviet Union on the world map,
and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian
students.","I believe Ron Paul’s position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right.

near Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him, Ho|ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho|ins in his face.

The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Ho|ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn‘t have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Ho|ins resisted arrest and
Claimed that Ho|ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops |itera|y lied and had no shame.

community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...

care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn’t Changed you...

Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be

people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.

As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn’t forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people’s love.
That’s cool that this love goes back and forth!

people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day

two tours of duty, to be deported. His name is Miguel Perez and he is Chicano

old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the US. Army and served
two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an
explosion. Perez served seven years, but because he is not a US. citizen,
Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and

began the deportation process.

way it will only benefit gringos. Miguel Perez is a real hero, who was betrayed

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.

Kaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward
“Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures” which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.

“I’ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,” he said.

When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don‘t really care
about haters.

So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent

Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like
Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged
feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries
that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a ""defender"" of the minorities.

So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.

him. There's no doubt he has reasons to think so.

Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa
Caucus. At the same time, she has already demonstrated that she prefers
destroying the nation than losing election. She pledged not to deport illegal
aliens. Moreover, it's known that Hillary is going to take in about one million
Muslim refugees, if she is president.

“I’m telling you, Nov. 8, we’d better be careful, because that election is going
to be rigged,” Mr. Trump said. “And I hope the Republicans are watching
Closely or it’s going to be taken away from us.”","Donald Trump is afraid that the 2016 general election will be “rigged” against

fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This
is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without
prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black
person’s life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the
second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.

October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall. Organizers of the

Latinos and incarcerated.

They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
radical groups. Only black activists say “black lives matter”, forgetting the fact
thatjustice is when all lives matter.

Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
be imprisoned.

Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan’s
benevolent intentions.

This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal

American extremists to execute him.

was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need

lands. The journey was led by Sarah Pemberton member of the Delaware
Nation. Sarah and her partner Kyle Harris created a movie about the journey
called ""The Water Gap: Return to the Homelands"" which already won the
award at the Native American Film Festival of the Southeast.
Propaganda of native culture and traditions is one of most powerful weapons
in Native American fight for their rights. People have always tried to destroy
things they don’t understand. And white people never understood native

nothing about their culture. Films, journeys, even videos on Youtube, can

help.","Native American teens made an interesting journey through their ancestral
